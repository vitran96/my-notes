[[JSON]] Web Token or JWT
A way to authenticate server
It usually use for authentication between service

My findings after using it is that it is not really a good tool for session management.
It also seems to have problem and bad for security.

[[PASETO]] is a recommended alternative.
[[OpenConnect]] and [[OAuth]] are also good replacement
